There are a few issues with the code that have yet to be resolved - 

1) The web app is not hosted on a live server so the owner would have to run server but the run server code is not uploaded into the learning logs repository yet

2) the web app does not have venv start command in the repository

3) the yaml section of the project was started but has not been completed due to the web app never being launched into a live server
